:zap: **Fastest way to build HTML and CSS static sites.**

You don't have to learn complicated tools to build simple websites in a modular way.

Alaska uses efficient technology that's similar to what you're used to.

| Technology | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [**PugJS**](https://pugjs.org/) | Templating tool for building HTML in a beautiful and modular way. <br> It's basically HTML, but modular, programmable, and without closing tags. |
| [**Sass**](https://sass-lang.com/) | CSS processor that extends the capabilities of current CSS. |
| [**GulpJS**](https://gulpjs.com/) | File processor to watch your files as you edit, reload the page on save, and build minified files. |

## Running Alaska

Running Alaska is quite simple. You just install all the `npm` dependencies and you're good to go. 

But if you need some in-depth guidance, I'll hand it off to Poh, a friendly Polar Bear that will guide you on your journey to building in Alaska.

> 🐻‍❄️ <br>**LET'S GO!!!**

Chill, Poh. They want instructions, not hype.

> 🐻‍❄️ <br>Shut up. YOU! Let's go...

### Requirements

> 🐻‍❄️ <br>If you want to do any running in Alaska, you have to prepare. 
> <br>And I'm not talking about warm clothes and water. 
> <br>I'm taking about N-P-M ᵐᵒᵗʰᵉʳᶠᵘᶜᵏᵉʳ`
>
> **Here's what you need to have installed on your machine:**

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) - Click to install.
* [NPM Cli](https://github.com/npm/cli) - Click to learn how to install if Node didn't already install it.
* [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) _(Optional)_ - Run: `npm i -g yarn` to install.
* [Gulp Cli](https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/quick-start) - Run `npm i -g gulp-cli` to install.

> 🐻‍❄️ <br>Now we need to pull all the files from Github.
> <br>Go to your Projects folder `cd ~/projects/` or whatever you use.
> <br>Then clone the project like this:

```
git clone git@github.com:pixelsbyeryc/alaska.git
```
_If you have SSH_

```
git clone https://github.com/pixelsbyeryc/alaska.git
```
_In case you're cloning from HTTPS_

### Installing

> 🐻‍❄️ <br>Now what you have the code on your computer, 
> <br>we're going to install the dependencies.
> <br>It's as simple as:

```
yarn
```
_If you like using yarn instead of npm, or..._

```
npm i
```
_If you prefer the bland outputs of npm. Your choice._

### Commands

> 🐻‍❄️ <br>There are two commands you can run:

```
yarn dev
```
_Will watch the files for any changes and hotreload your browser._

```
yarn build
```
_Will build your project under the folder_ `/public`

> 🐻‍❄️ <br>Want to stop the terminal from running?
> <br>Press Control+C on your terminal. It'll stop the execution.

## Build in Alaska

> 🐻‍❄️ <br>To build in Alaska, you need to understand how the structure works.
> <br>We like to break our ~~food~~, I mean, code in small portions, you feel me?
> 
> Lemme give you the ins-and-outs of this place...

### Structure

> 🐻‍❄️ <br>Here's your folder/file structure:

```
alaska
|   .gitignore
|   gulpfile
|   LICENSE    
│   package.json
│   README.md
|   yarn.lock
│
└───src
│   └───js
│   |   │   magic.js
│   |   └   ...
|   |   
│   └───sass
│   │   |   sassy.sass
│   │   └   ...
|   |   
│   └───views
|       └───_data
│       |   |   data.pug
│       |   └   ...
│       |   
|       └───_includes
│       |   |   head.pug
│       |   └   ...
│       |   
|       └───components
│       |   |   header.pug
│       |   |   footer.pug
│       |   └   ...
│       |   
|       └───layouts
│       |   |   base.pug
│       |   └   ...
│       |   
|       └───pages
│           |   index.pug
│           └   ...
│   
└───public
    └   ...
```

#### Source Files `src`

> 🐻‍❄️ <br>Source files are the ones you'll be editing.
> 
> Once will you run `yarn dev` or `yarn build`, Gulp will automatically process your files and spill them into the `public` folder.

#### Public Files `public`

> 🐻‍❄️ <br>Public files are ready for deployment.
>
> They will have pretty and minified options for your JS and CSS files.
> <br>You can also set up in your [Gulpfile.js](#gulpfile) to minify your HTMLs for a slimmer code.

#### Views `src/views`

> 🐻‍❄️ <br>Views folder will encompass all your Pug files — your HTML.
>
> If If you need help coding in Pug, check out [Poh's Guide](#coding-with-poh-🐻‍❄️).
>
> Let's go over them:

* **Pages** `src/views/pages`: This is where your single pages will live (eg: Home Page). You can add as many pages as you want. All of the `.pug` files here will be sent to the `public` folder.
* **Layouts** `src/views/layouts`: Layouts are used to set up the basic structure of a page. You can re-use layouts on as many pages as you want.
* **Components** `src/views/components`: Components help you to split up your code and make it more maintainable. You can also create components as [Pug Mixins](https://pugjs.org/language/mixins.html) and pass data to them.
* **Includes** `src/views/_includes`: Includes are chucks of code, much like components: they help you split up your HTML and make it more maintainable. I usually use them for things like `<head> ... </head>`.
* **Data** `src/views/_data`: You can write JSON-like files with Pug and use them to iterate components so you don't have to write the same structure over and over and over again.

#### Styles `src/sass`
> 🐻‍❄️ <br>Sass folder will encompass all your Sass files — your CSS.
>
> For now, we only have our `sassy.sass` — which is the main file.
> <br>But we encourage you to create more files and organize them as you wish.
>
> **Note:** Currently, Gulp only moves `sassy.sass` as `sassy.css` to the `public` folder. If you want to add another file to `public`, modify your [Gulpfile](#gulpfile).
>
> If If you need help coding in Sass, check out [Poh's Guide](#coding-with-poh-🐻‍❄️).

#### Scripts `src/js`
> 🐻‍❄️ <br>Scripts folder will encompass all your JS.
>
> For now, we only have one file called `magic.js`.
> <br>You can create as many files as you want.
>
> **Note:** Currently, Gulp only moves `magic.js` to the `public` folder. If you want to add another js file to `public`, modify your [Gulpfile](#gulpfile).

### Gulpfile
> 🐻‍❄️ <br>Gulpfile uses functions to process specific files.
>
> I'm lazy to keep writing this doc right now, so here's the file: [gulpfile.js](https://github.com/pixelsbyeryc/alaska/blob/main/gulpfile.js).
> <br>Check it out.

### Poh's Guide to Pug
> 🐻‍❄️ <br>Coming soon!
>
> Here's a preview of how a Pug file turns into an HTML file:

`file.pug`
```
body.class
    header.header
        nav.nav-links
            a(href="/", target="_blank") Link Text

    main.main
        section.section
            h1.heading.--huge Page Title
            p This is a paragraph.
```

`file.html`
```html
<body class="class">
    <header class="header">
        <nav class="nav-links">
            <a href="/" target="_blank">
                Link Text
            </a>
        </nav>
    </header>
    <main class="main">
        <section class="section">
            <h1 class="heading --huge">
                Title
            </h1>
            <p> This is a paragraph.
        </section>
    </main>
</body>
```
